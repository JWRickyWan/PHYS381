* Dealing with data in csv files
There are 640 csv files in the directory =/home/cmckay/clusters/CQM=. For each of these files, to the following:
- load the file into a pandas dataframe
- Calculate the ratio of the starting energy (the first value in column 'E') to the ending energy (the last value in column ('E').
- Calculate the median values of each of the six coordinate columns (the ones with =(t)= in their names)
- Calculate the median of $T/E$ (you will first have to calculate $T/E$!)

Put your results in a dataframe (you may use the file names with or without the =.csv= extension as your index) and write the dataframe
to a csv file in your homework directory. Call it "HW7.csv".
